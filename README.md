Python version of Berlin clock(http://agilekatas.co.uk/katas/BerlinClock-Kata), ported from my java project.

Unit testing:
`python -m unittest BrerlinClockTest
`

Running the application:
`python  BerlinClockRun.py "10::11:00"
`

where  "10::11:00" could be any time conforming to regular expression `"(\d{2})::(\d{2}):(\d{2})"`
